# Classes

This is extremely important part in python programming.
Every list object in python has these methods
![syntax demo](/images/45_classes_example.png)

we can create objects and this object would have methods like add, remove, get total etc.
Example:
```python
# 45_classes_examples.py
shopping_cart.add()
shopping_cart.remove()
shopping_cart.get_total()
```
Also we could have a point object with methods like draw, move, or get distance etc.
```python
# 45_classes_examples.py
point.draw()
point.move()
point.get_distance()
```
Class is a blue print for creating new objects

For example  
x = 1  
print(type(x))

Certain terms to be studied in this section.
